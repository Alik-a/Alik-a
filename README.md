 Hi, I’m Ali, I was a physician (still intern of Anaesthesia) but gradually attracted to the light of hacking & designing new things ! 
 I’m interested in WebDev !communication oriented, syntax agnostic.
 After a short introductory fun tour between many separate desciplines and paths ( data analysis, Maths, data engineering, python & JS, backend webdev... etc) I realized that I need to deviate back to to the fundamentalist track of grasping the concepts of CS, i.e. Data structures, Algorithms, CLI, basics of design patterns...   
 I’m so into contribution and spending hours for noble causes: humanitarian, animal welfare, environmental, defending the weaks.
